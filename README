How to build:

	secilc `/bin/find ./src -type f \( -iname "*.cil" \) | /bin/cut -d/ -f2-`


IMPORTANT

Some tmpfiles snippets refer to /var/run instead of /run and this causes issues

	Known culprits:

	/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/pam.conf
	/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/libselinux.conf

	To solve:

	cp /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/pam.conf /etc/tmpfiles.d/ && \
		sed -i 's/\/var\/run/\/run/' /etc/tmpfiles.d/pam.conf
	cp /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/libselinux.conf /etc/tmpfiles.d/ && \
		sed -i 's/\/var\/run/\/run/' /etc/tmpfiles.d/libselinux.conf
